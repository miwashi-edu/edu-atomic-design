## Understanding Atomic Design: Template Level Components

### The Goal of Template Components

Template components in atomic design represent structured layouts that arrange organisms, molecules, and atoms into predefined layouts. They do not contain actual content but instead define the structure of a page or section. The goals of template components are:

1. **Scalable Structure**: Templates define a consistent structure for pages, allowing content and components to fit seamlessly into their predefined slots.

2. **Reusability**: They are reusable layouts that can be adapted across multiple pages by populating them with different content or components.

3. **Consistency**: By defining consistent layouts, templates ensure that pages have a cohesive structure, enhancing the user experience.

4. **Flexibility**: Templates act as blueprints, making it easy to switch or rearrange components without affecting the overall layout.

### Using Templates with Storybook

Storybook can be used to visualize templates to understand how different components will appear in their slots:

1. **Organism-Level Storybook**: Some projects may choose to stop visualizing components at the organism level in Storybook, focusing on smaller-scale UI components.

2. **Separate Storybook for Templates**: Others may prefer to separate templates into a different Storybook setup, ensuring that complex layouts don't overwhelm the component library.

3. **Combined Storybook**: A single Storybook instance can be used to include both organisms and templates, enabling a comprehensive view of the design system.

### Example: Dashboard Template

A typical example of a template is a Dashboard layout:

```jsx
// DashboardTemplate.jsx
import React from 'react';
import Header from './Header';
import Sidebar from './Sidebar';

const DashboardTemplate = ({ children }) => {
  return (
    <div className="dashboard-layout">
      <Header />
      <Sidebar />
      <main>{children}</main>
    </div>
  );
};

export default DashboardTemplate;
```
