## React Hooks and Their Use in Atomic Design

### **Atoms**
- **`useState`**:
  - Often used to manage state for individual atom components, such as toggling a button or managing the value of an input field.

### **Molecules**
- **`useState`**:
  - Still frequently used here, especially to handle state for interactive molecules (e.g., forms, dropdowns).
- **`useEffect`**:
  - Sometimes used to handle side effects that occur within a molecule, such as fetching suggestions for an autocomplete component.

### **Organisms**
- **`useState`**:
  - Managing the internal state of an organism, such as a complex form or a modal dialog.
- **`useEffect`**:
  - More commonly used here to handle data fetching, subscriptions, or manual DOM manipulation needed for the organism to function.
- **`useNavigate`**:
  - Used to handle navigation logic within an organism, such as redirecting to a different route when a user interacts with a component
  (e.g., clicking on a card to navigate to a detail page).

### **Templates**
- **`useContext`**:
  - Useful for sharing state or configurations across various organisms within a template.
- **`useEffect`**:
  - Often used to manage data fetching that affects multiple organisms displayed in the template.
- **`useReducer`**:
  - May be used to manage more complex state transitions involving multiple organisms within a template.

### **Pages**
- **`useContext`**:
  - For managing global state that affects the entire page, such as theme or user authentication data.
- **`useEffect`**:
  - Heavily used for handling global side effects, like fetching data necessary for the entire page.
- **`useReducer`**:
  - Suitable for managing the overall state of the page, especially if there are complex state changes that involve multiple templates or organisms.
- **`useNavigate`**:
  - Utilized to handle routing between different pages, ensuring smooth navigation throughout the application.
